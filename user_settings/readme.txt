HOW TO USE THE USER_SETTINGS

IMPORTANT INFORMATION BELOW: 

This folder defined "user_settings" is designed to store project specific information.
Upload an project unique logo (.png file) in the "user_logo" folder and make sure you call "logo.png"

in "config.json" set project specific information. 

Important;
In the current development it's not possible to keep track of show-states in the config.json file
It is on the to-do list to combine this in one file, but for now;
use the "global.js" in the variables folder for global styling - dedicated to the project, as well as show states.
Also define the custom triggerNumbers which the app should fire to the Pharos controller.
